# DBMS_Project
We have made  a web application which will act like a platform for people to book
tickets for a concert taking place in theaters and auditorium with various categories of halls, so that
people can choose their available seats if they wish to do so.

## Features
We have implemented various features such as -
- The web app will allow a new user to register into the system.
- Users who have already registered can log in directly into the portal.
- The user can view all the bookings they have made till date.
- The user can view all the bookings of upcoming concerts.
- Users will have access to variety of different halls, such as AC, Open Roof and so on.
- User can book tickets of a show by choosing the seats on a screen where it will be shown which seats are available and which seats are occupied.
- We have implemented a user wallet from which user can pay for their tickets.
- User will also have option to add money into their wallet.
